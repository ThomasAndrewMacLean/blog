title: NPM package to add made with love footer
---

One thing I like adding to all sites I create is a footer with a link to my homepage.
I used to copy paste it, or rewrite it for every sideproject I did, but this meant changing it every time depending on what framework I was using.

A few weeks ago I gave a small talk at the office on how you can create NPM packages, and this looked like a legit reason to create one that would be usefull (for me at least).
For now its just a simple IIFE that injects a footer element in your document and adds some inline styling using JS. I may change it up a bit so you could run it as a function and pass in argument for the name and the link.

The bots scraping npm also give you a small ego-boost ðŸ¤£

Also still have to find a way how I can include the snippet in this blog.
